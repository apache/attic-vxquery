Updating the Apache VXQuery\x99 site

* One time steps

  * set up directory structure

    There usually are 2 directories at the same level

    * the source directory <<<vxquery>>>,

    * the <<<site>>> directory, and

    The source directory is version-controlled by <<<git>>>, the other is
    version controlled by <<<svn>>>.
    While the source directory can have an arbitrary name and location,
    the <<<site>>> directory has to be called <<<site>>> and it needs to
    be at the same level as the source directory to enable site deployment.

    Assuming that the source directory is available one can create the
    directory structure by going to the directory that contains the
    source directory and checking out the distribution and site
    directories:

---
$ svn co https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/release/vxquery dist
$ svn co https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/vxquery/site
---

* For each update

  * update the <<<site>>> branch in git

    * New release steps

    Please switch to the {{{http://vxquery.apache.org/development_release.html}release steps}}
    and follow their directions.

    * Incremental site update

    When pushing changes to the site without a code release, the following git
    commands will create a patch of only differences within the src/site folder.
    Please verify the patch before applying it the site

-----
git checkout master
git diff site src/site/ > ../site.patch"
git checkout site
git apply ../site.patch
----

  * build a new site and deploy it to <<<../site>>>

---
$ mvn site site:deploy
---

  * submit the site to svn

---
$ cd ../site
$ svn st | awk '/\?/ { print $2 }' | xargs svn add # add all new files
$ svn ci -m"updated site"
$ cd -
---
